# How I Built My First Home Server 🖥️

_Published on June 24, 2025_

Ever since I got into self-hosting, I’ve wanted to build my own home server. Here’s how I did it:

## 🧱 Parts I Used

| Component | Model                  |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| CPU       | Ryzen 5 5600G          |
| RAM       | 32GB DDR4              |
| Storage   | 1TB NVMe SSD + 4TB HDD |
| Case      | Fractal Node 304       |

## 🛠️ Setup Process

1. Installed Ubuntu Server
2. Configured SSH and static IP
3. Installed Docker and Portainer
4. Set up Nextcloud, Pi-hole, and Jellyfin

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- Use ECC RAM if you care about data integrity
- Keep backups — RAID is not a backup!
- Document your setup!

> Self-hosting is a journey — start small, learn as you go.

Happy homelabbing!
